Types of Proposals
 - Hard (Demand)
	- High / Low priority
	    --- what if Demand not met?
		
 - Soft (Requests)
	- Leases (Loans/Sublet offers)
    - Buy offers	
	 
Actions
 - Buy (Obtain more nodes, premium for preempted nodes) 
 - Sublet(Loan, temp release of resource, changes to high priority demand at end of sublet)
 - Sell (Release resources)
 - Seized (Preempted by system)

--- How to signal process of scheduled loss, how should process deal with it. How much head time is needed for clean transfer? - Likely application dependent - Query app?
    -- continue to end of alloc
	-- abort early (if subletting terminate clause early)
--- How to handle hardware errors, soft (see the error coming), hard (sudden catatropic error). 	


Priority
   - scaliablity 
       - strong
	   - weak
	- req size
	- min size
	- max size
	
Items to be updated dynamically
		- min size
		- max size
		- progress
		
credits -- what if min/max changes?? - add buffer amount?? - 
    - penaltize massive overestimation by lower priority.... kind of what backfill system currently does indirectly. 
    time X maximum nodes?
	assume 100% efficiency at min nodes??? 
	
metrics
 - System - acutal & effective utlization, span    actual = basic * effective? should always be 1 or less, the higher the better. Only useful at end, not during runtime
                                                   Runtime metric??? --- Footprint (should not penalize score if pending queue empty and footprint < resources available)
												                     --- Elasticity (how much room to maneuver things around)
																	 --- Instant effective utilization (only useful if scaliablity curve is known)
																	 --- Num job runnning
Penality for high Priority???

What is a Tensor?
Tensor workflow looks to fit model, potentially
Use single interation -
Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge, Ploynomial Regression
Decision Tree, graidnt boost 
vector regression , gaussian process Regression, Kernal ridge
